# recipie-finder

A basic project working with the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape recipe ingredients and directions off a website without having to sift through paragraphs on paragraphs of story. Specific parsers are setup for two popular sites: allrecipies and foodnetwork, and I am happy to add more if an issue is opened.
